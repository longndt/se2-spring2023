PAYMENT METHOD IN AN E-COMMERCE APP

In this example, the Strategy pattern is used to implement 
the various payment methods in an e-commerce application. 
After selecting a product to purchase, a customer picks
 a payment method: either Paypal or credit card.

Concrete strategies not only perform the actual payment 
but also alter the behavior of the checkout form, 
providing appropriate fields to record payment details.
